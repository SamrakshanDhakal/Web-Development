# 🎵 Elektrik Eel Festival Website

A responsive, multi-page front-end website built to promote the fictional **Elektrik Eel Festival** – a large-scale, 3-day music event showcasing international and local artists. This project was developed as part of my undergraduate coursework to demonstrate web design, user interface, and interactive feature skills using core front-end technologies.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Multi-Page Navigation**: Includes Home, Artists, and Tickets sections.
- **Interactive UI**: Hamburger menu for mobile navigation and hover effects for artist cards.
- **Custom Styling**: Built entirely with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript—no front-end frameworks used.
- **Figma Integration**: UI prototyped in Figma before development.
- **Clean Code**: Modular, well-commented code structure for easy understanding and reuse.
